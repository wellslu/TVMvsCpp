# C++ Model Code

## Step
- [ ] 🎯 Develop different version of ResNet and MobileNet models using C++
  - [ ] ⏳ **(WIP)** ResNet-18/34/50
  - [ ] MobileNet(v1\~v3)
- [ ] 🛠️ Load weights of models trained using PyTorch
- [ ] 🏗️ Deploy models and weights to **raspberry pi**
- [ ] 📊 Compare the efficiency and accuracy of models with TVM
