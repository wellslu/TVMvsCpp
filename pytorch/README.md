# Pytorch Model Code

Training different version of ResNet and MobileNet model with MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. We build our model code instead of using pytorch pretrain model because we want to implement on edge device. Therefore, if the model is too large to put on raspberry pi, we can revise our model layer by ourselves. 

## Step
- [x] Programming pytorch code
- [x] Do unitest of inference model
- [x] Training different version models
  - [x] ResNet18
  - [x] ResNet34
  - [x] MobileNetV1
  - [x] MobileNetV2
  - [x] MobileNetV3
  - [x] MobileNetV3-Large
